# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Today I'm starting the 100 Days of Code Challenge
**Thoughts**:
I want to start learning Ruby on Rails while cleaning up some previous projects. -->

### Day 6: February 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Class today was...a lot. Spent some time on my portfolio and then a little bit of review on Codewars.

**Thoughts** I go back and forth feeling like this is the right path for me. I know it's been a short amount of time and I KNOW I have so much more knowledge under my belt than even a week ago but it is still tough. I've heard before that if there isn't a struggle, it probably isn't worth it. Time to keep pressing on!

**Link(s) to work**
Didn't pass all the tests but did get to see how flexible (and readable) Python can be.
